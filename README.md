#Super Pong
## Summary
A simple Pong game built in HTML5 and JavaScript, used as a base to build a "Super" Pong game. At the moment, the game continues until a player wins 3 matches.

## Features
1. **Two ball-deflection angles and speeds** - if you hit the ball with your paddle closer to either end of the paddle, the speed of the ball will increase and the angle at which it bounces will increase.

## Currently Known Bugs and Limitations
1. **Game play smoothness** - it's not terrible, but there is potential for the game play to be a bit smoother.
2. **Lack of configuration and options** - it's a very simple game with no options to set a winning score or anything.
3. **Game play continues even if winning is impossible** - the game does not complete until one of the players wins 3 matches, even if one player has won 2 matches (which means that player has already won).
